Use \texttt{require('crypto')} to access this module.

The crypto module offers a way of encapsulating secure credentials to be
used as part of a secure HTTPS net or http connection.

It also offers a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, hmac, cipher,
decipher, sign and verify methods.

\url{http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt}.

\subsection{crypto.createHash(algorithm)}

\texttt{auto\_padding} is false, the length of the entire input data
must be a multiple of the cipher's block size or \texttt{final} will
fail. Useful for non-standard padding, e.g.~using \texttt{0x0} instead

{[}output\_encoding{]})}

Updates the decipher with \texttt{data}, which is encoded in
\texttt{'binary'}, \texttt{'base64'} or \texttt{'hex'}. If no encoding
is provided, then a buffer is expected.

The \texttt{output\_decoding} specifies in what format to return the
deciphered plaintext: \texttt{'binary'}, \texttt{'ascii'} or
\texttt{'utf8'}. If no encoding is provided, then a buffer is returned.

\subsubsection{decipher.final({[}output\_encoding{]})}

Returns any remaining plaintext which is deciphered, with
\texttt{output\_encoding} being one of: \texttt{'binary'},

Note: \texttt{decipher} object can not be used after \texttt{final()}
method has been called.

\subsubsection{decipher.setAutoPadding(auto\_padding=true)}

You can disable auto padding if the data has been encrypted without
standard block padding to prevent \texttt{decipher.final} from checking
and removing it. Can only work if the input data's length is a multiple
of the ciphers block size. You must call this before streaming data to
\texttt{decipher.update}.

\subsection{crypto.createSign(algorithm)}

Creates and returns a signing object, with the given algorithm. On

Returns the Diffie-Hellman public key in the specified encoding, which
can be \texttt{'binary'}, \texttt{'hex'}, or \texttt{'base64'}. If no
encoding is provided, then a buffer is returned.

\subsubsection{diffieHellman.getPrivateKey({[}encoding{]})}

\subsection{crypto.getDiffieHellman(group\_name)}

Creates a predefined Diffie-Hellman key exchange object. The supported
groups are: \texttt{'modp1'}, \texttt{'modp2'}, \texttt{'modp5'}
(defined in \href{http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2412.txt}{RFC 2412})
and \texttt{'modp14'}, \texttt{'modp15'}, \texttt{'modp16'},
\texttt{'modp17'}, \texttt{'modp18'} (defined in
\href{http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3526.txt}{RFC 3526}). The
returned object mimics the interface of objects created by
\hyperref[crypto\_crypto\_creatediffiehellman\_prime\_encoding]{crypto.createDiffieHellman()}
above, but will not allow to change the keys (with
\hyperref[crypto\_diffiehellman\_setpublickey\_public\_key\_encoding]{diffieHellman.setPublicKey()}
for example). The advantage of using this routine is that the parties
don't have to generate nor exchange group modulus beforehand, saving
both processor and communication time.

Example (obtaining a shared secret):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{var} \NormalTok{crypto = require(}\CharTok{'crypto'}\NormalTok{);}
\KeywordTok{var} \NormalTok{alice = }\KeywordTok{crypto}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{getDiffieHellman}\NormalTok{(}\CharTok{'modp5'}\NormalTok{);}
\KeywordTok{var} \NormalTok{bob = }\KeywordTok{crypto}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{getDiffieHellman}\NormalTok{(}\CharTok{'modp5'}\NormalTok{);}

\KeywordTok{alice}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{generateKeys}\NormalTok{();}
\KeywordTok{bob}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{generateKeys}\NormalTok{();}

\KeywordTok{var} \NormalTok{alice_secret = }\KeywordTok{alice}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{computeSecret}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{bob}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{getPublicKey}\NormalTok{(), null, }\CharTok{'hex'}\NormalTok{);}
\KeywordTok{var} \NormalTok{bob_secret = }\KeywordTok{bob}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{computeSecret}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{alice}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{getPublicKey}\NormalTok{(), null, }\CharTok{'hex'}\NormalTok{);}

\CommentTok{/* alice_secret and bob_secret should be the same */}
\KeywordTok{console}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{log}\NormalTok{(alice_secret == bob_secret);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keylen, callback)}

Asynchronous PBKDF2 applies pseudorandom function HMAC-SHA1 to derive a
key of given length from the given password, salt and iterations. The
callback gets two arguments \texttt{(err, derivedKey)}.

\subsection{crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, iterations, keylen)}

Synchronous PBKDF2 function. Returns derivedKey or throws error.

\subsection{crypto.randomBytes(size, {[}callback{]})}

Generates cryptographically strong pseudo-random data. Usage:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{// async}
\KeywordTok{crypto}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{randomBytes}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{256}\NormalTok{, }\KeywordTok{function}\NormalTok{(ex, buf) \{}
  \KeywordTok{if} \NormalTok{(ex) }\KeywordTok{throw} \NormalTok{ex;}
  \KeywordTok{console}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{log}\NormalTok{(}\CharTok{'Have %d bytes of random data: %s'}\NormalTok{, }\KeywordTok{buf}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{, buf);}
\NormalTok{\});}

\CommentTok{// sync}
\KeywordTok{try} \NormalTok{\{}
  \KeywordTok{var} \NormalTok{buf = }\KeywordTok{crypto}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{randomBytes}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{256}\NormalTok{);}
  \KeywordTok{console}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{log}\NormalTok{(}\CharTok{'Have %d bytes of random data: %s'}\NormalTok{, }\KeywordTok{buf}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{, buf);}
\NormalTok{\} }\KeywordTok{catch} \NormalTok{(ex) \{}
  \CommentTok{// handle error}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{crypto.pseudoRandomBytes(size, {[}callback{]})}

Generates \emph{non}-cryptographically strong pseudo-random data. The
data returned will be unique if it is sufficiently long, but is not
necessarily unpredictable. For this reason, the output of this function
should never be used where unpredictability is important, such as in the
generation of encryption keys.

Usage is otherwise identical to \texttt{crypto.randomBytes}.

\subsection{Class: Certificate}

The class used for working with signed public key \& challenges. The
most common usage for this series of functions is when dealing with the
\texttt{\textless{}keygen\textgreater{}} element.
http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/spkac.html

Returned by \texttt{crypto.Certificate}.

\subsubsection{Certificate.verifySpkac(spkac)}

Returns true of false based on the validity of the SPKAC.

\subsubsection{Certificate.exportChallenge(spkac)}

Exports the encoded public key from the supplied SPKAC.

\subsubsection{Certificate.exportPublicKey(spkac)}

Exports the encoded challenge associated with the SPKAC.

\subsection{crypto.DEFAULT\_ENCODING}

The default encoding to use for functions that can take either strings
or buffers. The default value is \texttt{'buffer'}, which makes it
default to using Buffer objects. This is here to make the crypto module
more easily compatible with legacy programs that expected
\texttt{'binary'} to be the default encoding.

Note that new programs will probably expect buffers, so only use this as
a temporary measure.

\subsection{Recent API Changes}

The Crypto module was added to Node before there was the concept of a
unified Stream API, and before there were Buffer objects for handling
binary data.

As such, the streaming classes don't have the typical methods found on
other Node classes, and many methods accepted and returned
Binary-encoded strings by default rather than Buffers. This was changed
to use Buffers by default instead.

This is a breaking change for some use cases, but not all.

For example, if you currently use the default arguments to the Sign
class, and then pass the results to the Verify class, without ever
inspecting the data, then it will continue to work as before. Where you
once got a binary string and then presented the binary string to the
Verify object, you'll now get a Buffer, and present the Buffer to the
Verify object.

However, if you were doing things with the string data that will not
work properly on Buffers (such as, concatenating them, storing in
databases, etc.), or you are passing binary strings to the crypto
functions without an encoding argument, then you will need to start
providing encoding arguments to specify which encoding you'd like to
use. To switch to the previous style of using binary strings by default,
set the \texttt{crypto.DEFAULT\_ENCODING} field to `binary'. Note that
new programs will probably expect buffers, so only use this as a
temporary measure.
