\section{Global Objects}

These objects are available in all modules. Some of these objects aren't
actually in the global scope but in the module scope - this will be
noted.

\subsection{global}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{Object\} The global namespace object.
\end{itemize}

In browsers, the top-level scope is the global scope. That means that in
browsers if you're in the global scope \texttt{var something} will
define a global variable. In Node this is different. The top-level scope
is not the global scope; \texttt{var something} inside a Node module
will be local to that module.

\subsection{process}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{Object\}
\end{itemize}

The process object. See the
\href{process.html\#process\_process}{process object} section.

\subsection{console}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{Object\}
\end{itemize}

Used to print to stdout and stderr. See the \href{stdio.html}{stdio}
section.

\subsection{Class: Buffer}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{Function\}
\end{itemize}

Used to handle binary data. See the \href{buffer.html}{buffer section}

\subsection{require()}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{Function\}
\end{itemize}

To require modules. See the
\href{modules.html\#modules\_modules}{Modules} section. \texttt{require}
isn't actually a global but rather local to each module.

\subsubsection{require.resolve()}

Use the internal \texttt{require()} machinery to look up the location of
a module, but rather than loading the module, just return the resolved
filename.

\subsubsection{require.cache}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{Object\}
\end{itemize}

Modules are cached in this object when they are required. By deleting a
key value from this object, the next \texttt{require} will reload the
module.

\subsubsection{require.extensions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{Array\}
\end{itemize}

Instruct \texttt{require} on how to handle certain file extensions.

Process files with the extension \texttt{.sjs} as \texttt{.js}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{require}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{extensions}\NormalTok{[}\CharTok{'.sjs'}\NormalTok{] = }\KeywordTok{require}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{extensions}\NormalTok{[}\CharTok{'.js'}\NormalTok{];}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{\_\_filename}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{String\}
\end{itemize}

The filename of the code being executed. This is the resolved absolute
path of this code file. For a main program this is not necessarily the
same filename used in the command line. The value inside a module is the
path to that module file.

Example: running \texttt{node example.js} from \texttt{/Users/mjr}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{console}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{log}\NormalTok{(__filename);}
\CommentTok{// /Users/mjr/example.js}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{\_\_filename} isn't actually a global but rather local to each
module.

\subsection{\_\_dirname}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{String\}
\end{itemize}

The name of the directory that the currently executing script resides
in.

Example: running \texttt{node example.js} from \texttt{/Users/mjr}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{console}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{log}\NormalTok{(__dirname);}
\CommentTok{// /Users/mjr}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{\_\_dirname} isn't actually a global but rather local to each
module.

\subsection{module}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \{Object\}
\end{itemize}

A reference to the current module. In particular \texttt{module.exports}
is the same as the \texttt{exports} object. \texttt{module} isn't
actually a global but rather local to each module.

See the \href{modules.html}{module system documentation} for more
information.

\subsection{exports}

An object which is shared between all instances of the current module
and made accessible through \texttt{require()}. \texttt{exports} is the
same as the \texttt{module.exports} object. \texttt{exports} isn't
actually a global but rather local to each module.

See the \href{modules.html}{module system documentation} for more
information.

See the \href{modules.html}{module section} for more information.

\subsection{setTimeout(cb, ms)}

Run callback \texttt{cb} after \emph{at least} \texttt{ms} milliseconds.
The actual delay depends on external factors like OS timer granularity
and system load.

The timeout must be in the range of 1-2,147,483,647 inclusive. If the
value is outside that range, it's changed to 1 millisecond. Broadly
speaking, a timer cannot span more than 24.8 days.

Returns an opaque value that represents the timer.

\subsection{clearTimeout(t)}

Stop a timer that was previously created with \texttt{setTimeout()}. The
callback will not execute.

\subsection{setInterval(cb, ms)}

Run callback \texttt{cb} repeatedly every \texttt{ms} milliseconds. Note
that the actual interval may vary, depending on external factors like OS
timer granularity and system load. It's never less than \texttt{ms} but
it may be longer.

The interval must be in the range of 1-2,147,483,647 inclusive. If the
value is outside that range, it's changed to 1 millisecond. Broadly
speaking, a timer cannot span more than 24.8 days.

Returns an opaque value that represents the timer.

\subsection{clearInterval(t)}

Stop a timer that was previously created with \texttt{setInterval()}.
The callback will not execute.

The timer functions are global variables. See the
\href{timers.html}{timers} section.
